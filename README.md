VEM

Veespo Event Manager
--------------------

VEM is a fully-customizable web page which is generally run from localhost and is projected onto a screen during live events.

When used in combination with Veespo on a smartphone, people can express opinions (or more simply rate) one or more subjects during an event. VEM allows the results to be projected in real-time as they arrive and can also display the subjects ranked by their average rating, if desired.

People can express their ratings from their smartphones using either a bespoke application or by using a general-purpose application called Veespo Lite, which can be served either as a web app (http://veespo.com/lite) or as a native iOS application (https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/veespo-lite/id785507111)

Quick Start
------
Using VEM for your own event is very simple and will only take a few minutes to set-up. You will need to follow these steps:
- Create a veespo manager account at http://veespo.com/dashboard
- Within the dashboard, create an organization, a category, some targets and some tags (explanations of each of these can be found in the dashboard documentation)
- Download VEM to a local folder on your computer
- Decide on an id for your event (we'll use 'my-event')
- Choose a demo (eg demo-c-2-2) and create a copy of both the folder and the corresponding html file, calling them 'my-event' and 'my-event.html' respectively.
- Update the paths in my-event.html so that they now point to the my-event folder
- Edit js/settings.js within the copied folder to reflect your input in the dashboard (instructions are in the file itself)
- You're good to go!
- By opening my-event.html in the browser you should see the targets you created earlier in the dashboard (login with the same credentials).
- All you need to do now is customize the page to your liking
